    general: [
      {
        question: 'What is solar energy and how does it work?',
        answer: 'Solar energy is power generated from sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) panels. Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it knocks electrons loose, creating an electric current that can be used to power your home or business.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is solar energy suitable for Pakistan\'s climate?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! Pakistan has excellent solar potential with 300+ sunny days per year and high solar irradiation levels. Cities like Lahore, Karachi, and Faisalabad receive 4-6 kWh/mÂ²/day of solar energy, making solar installations highly effective and profitable.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How much can I save with solar energy?',
        answer: 'Most customers save 70-90% on their electricity bills. A typical residential system pays for itself in 3-4 years and continues to generate free electricity for 25+ years. Commercial customers often see even greater savings due to higher electricity consumption rates.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is net metering and how does it work in Pakistan?',
        answer: 'Net metering allows you to sell excess solar energy back to the grid and receive credits on your electricity bill. In Pakistan, NEPRA regulates net metering, and we handle all the paperwork and approvals. You get paid for surplus energy at the same rate you buy electricity.'
      }
    ],
    cost: [
      {
        question: 'How much does a solar system cost?',
        answer: 'Residential systems typically range from PKR 150,000 to PKR 2,000,000 depending on size and quality. Commercial systems start from PKR 1,500,000. The exact cost depends on your energy needs, roof type, location, and equipment selection. We provide free detailed quotes.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What financing options are available?',
        answer: 'We offer multiple payment options: full upfront payment (with maximum discount), installment plans (3-12 months), and connections to solar financing partners. Some banks offer special solar loans at attractive rates. We help you find the best option for your budget.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are there any government incentives for solar in Pakistan?',
        answer: 'Yes! The government offers several incentives: no customs duty on solar equipment, reduced sales tax, accelerated depreciation for businesses, and net metering policies that allow selling excess energy back to the grid.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the return on investment (ROI) for solar?',
        answer: 'Most solar systems have an ROI of 25-30% annually. With current electricity prices and solar costs, typical payback period is 3-4 years for residential and 2-3 years for commercial systems. After payback, you enjoy 20+ years of free electricity.'
      }
    ],
    installation: [
      {
        question: 'How long does installation take?',
        answer: 'Residential installations typically take 2-5 days, commercial projects 1-4 weeks, and industrial installations 2-8 weeks depending on system size and complexity. We provide detailed timelines during the design phase.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the installation process?',
        answer: 'Our process includes: 1) Site survey and energy audit, 2) System design and approvals, 3) Equipment procurement, 4) Professional installation, 5) System testing and commissioning, 6) Grid connection and net metering setup, 7) Documentation and handover.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need any permits or approvals?',
        answer: 'We handle all necessary permits and approvals including NEPRA net metering application, utility company coordination, and local building permissions where required. Our team manages the entire paperwork process for you.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will solar work on my roof type?',
        answer: 'Solar panels can be installed on most roof types including concrete, tile, metal sheets, and flat roofs. We assess structural capacity, orientation, shading, and access during our site survey to design the optimal system for your specific roof.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if my roof needs repairs after installation?',
        answer: 'We can temporarily remove and reinstall panels if major roof work is needed. Our mounting systems are designed for easy removal. We also inspect roof condition during site survey and recommend any necessary repairs before installation.'
      }
    ],
    maintenance: [
      {
        question: 'How much maintenance do solar panels require?',
        answer: 'Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning (monthly in dusty areas), visual inspections, and annual professional check-ups are usually sufficient. We offer maintenance contracts for hassle-free operation.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What warranties do you provide?',
        answer: 'We provide comprehensive warranties: 25 years on solar panels, 10 years on inverters, 5-10 years on batteries (if applicable), and 2 years on installation workmanship. All equipment comes with manufacturer warranties plus our service guarantee.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I clean solar panels?',
        answer: 'Clean panels monthly with water and a soft brush or cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals and pressure washing. Clean early morning or evening when panels are cool. For safety and optimal results, consider our professional cleaning service.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if something goes wrong with my system?',
        answer: 'We provide 24/7 technical support and emergency response. Our monitoring systems can detect issues remotely. We maintain spare parts inventory and have trained technicians across Punjab for quick response and repairs.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I monitor my system performance?',
        answer: 'Most systems include monitoring apps that show real-time and historical performance data on your smartphone. You can track energy production, consumption, savings, and system health. We also provide professional monitoring services.'
      }
    ],
    technical: [
      {
        question: 'What happens during power outages?',
        answer: 'Grid-tied systems automatically shut off during outages for safety. If you want backup power, we can install a hybrid system with batteries that provides power to essential loads during outages while maintaining grid connection benefits.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How efficient are solar panels?',
        answer: 'Modern solar panels we install are 20-22% efficient, meaning they convert 20-22% of sunlight into electricity. We use only Tier-1 panels from reputable manufacturers like Jinko, Canadian Solar, and LONGi for maximum efficiency and reliability.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What size system do I need?',
        answer: 'System size depends on your electricity consumption, roof space, and budget. A typical home uses 300-1000 units per month, requiring 3-15kW systems. We analyze your bills and energy usage to recommend the optimal system size.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I expand my system later?',
        answer: 'Yes, systems can usually be expanded if you have additional roof space and your electrical panel can handle the extra capacity. We design systems with future expansion in mind and can add panels or upgrade inverters as needed.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do solar panels perform in cloudy weather?',
        answer: 'Solar panels still generate electricity on cloudy days, though at reduced efficiency (10-25% of peak output). Pakistan\'s high annual sunshine hours more than compensate for cloudy days, ensuring excellent overall performance.'
      }
